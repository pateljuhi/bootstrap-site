                                <p id="card-text">One can do this by purchasing windows and window coverings that will block out or keep in warmth, and by sealing any existing cracks.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">In addition to carbon emissions, the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is also causing climate change as we continue to overload our environment with these harmful emissions. They are steadily increasing the planet’s temperature, and impacting our climate, and even our health negatively. The best way to overcome these effects is to switch to renewable energy, such as solar power, which has a higher capacity to meet global energy needs.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While coal- and natural gas-fired power plants produce high percentages of harmful emissions, solar energy emits no harmful gases. Instead, solar energy helps reduce the emissions of carbon and greenhouse gases, and therefore, mitigates global warming and climate change.</p>
                                <p class="card-text"> An absolutely free source of electricity is a blessing. It is available to us in abundance too. Most importantly, it is renewable and the entire planet can take advantage of it.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Planting trees can help much in reducing global warming then any other method. They not only give oxygen but also take in carbon dioxide, during the process of photosynthesis, which is the main source of global warming.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">When gardening, select plants that are well suited to your climate and require minimal watering and attention. Better yet, plant a tree, and it will provide shade and soak up carbon from the atmosphere.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Forests can cool the planet by absorbing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Forests can also cool the planet by evaporating water to the atmosphere and increasing cloudiness; a deck of white clouds reflects incoming solar radiation straight back out into space.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Trees can also have a warming effect because they are dark and absorb a lot of sunlight, holding heat near ground level.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Reduce your need to buy new products or use less, resulting in a smaller amount of waste. Even if you need to buy, consider buying eco-friendly products. It is most effective of the three R’s. It simply says cut back from where are you now.</p>
                                <p id="card-text">Reuse bottles, plastic containers, and other items bought at the grocery store. Reusing water bottles, yogurt cups, bread ties, and other items is being conscious about what is already out there. It will lessen having to purchase other items that would fulfill the same function. Try to use the disposable products into some other form. Just don’t throw them away.</p>
                                <p id="card-text">Recycling unwanted paper, bottles, etc…is a great earth saving tip. If possible, upcycle tables, furniture, and other outdated items to keep landfills clean. You can recycle almost anything for e.g.: paper, aluminum foils, cans, newspapers. By recycling you can help in reducing landfills.</p>
                                <p id="card-text">By recycling, you can help to reduce the need for the extraction of virgin raw materials from the earth, through activities such as mining and deforestation. This is important because mining and deforestation activities contribute substantially to pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
